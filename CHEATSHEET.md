# Rails Gotchas

Depending on your operating system and various application versions, you may find that you need
to tweak some configurations.

- Use config/database.yml tell rails how to connect to your database. You may need to add the username/password to the `development` section if you get database connection errors.
- When using the rails console, you may be required to run `Modelname.connection` to interact with Rails. Usually you'll see an error message that tells you exactly this.
